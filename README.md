### System Overview with DeepFace Integration

- **Real-time Detection**: Video stream is captured from the camera and processed frame by frame.
- **YOLOv5 Detection**: Fast and accurate face detection using YOLOv5.
- **Face Matching**: Face is compared with known faces using **OpenCV ORB** and **DeepFace** models for added verification.
- **Deepfake Prevention**: DeepFace helps detect deepfake faces based on deep learning models.
- **Anti-Spoofing**: ONNX models classify whether the detected face is real or spoofed.
- **Result Display**: The live feed in the browser shows a bounding box with a label ("Real" or "Spoof").
